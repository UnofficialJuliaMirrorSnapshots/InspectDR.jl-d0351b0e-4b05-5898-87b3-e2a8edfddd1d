# InspectDR.jl: Fast, Interactive Plots

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ma-laforge/InspectDR.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ma-laforge/InspectDR.jl)

## Description

InspectDR is a fast plotting tool with a responsive GUI, targeting quick navigation of simulation results.  In design applications, InspectDR allows for efficient, interactive data exploration, thus shortening each iteration of the design cycle.

**Motivation:** Despite their great quality, most of Julia's current plotting options were found to be either too slow, and/or provide inadequate interactivity for the author's needs.

The InspectDR library is implemented using **3 distinct plot layers**:

 - **Plot image layer:** Implemented with the [Cairo library](https://cairographics.org/), the plot image layer allows the user to render (multi-) plots as simple images.
 - **Plot widget layer:** Library users can also integrate plots to their own [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/) application by instantiating a single InspectDR widget.
 - **Plot application layer:** Most end users will likely display/interact with plots/data using the built-in Julia/[GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/) multi-plot application.

Users are encouraged to open an issue if it is unclear how to utilize a particular layer.  Documentation is a bit limited at the moment.

### Features/Highlights

#### Responsive

Quick to first plot, and easy to navigate data using supported [mouse/keybindings](#Bindings)

#### "F1" Acceleration

InspectDR.jl includes specialized algorithms to accellerate plotting of large "F1" datasets (functions of 1 argument) in order to maintain a good "real-time" (interactive) user experience.

A dataset is defined as a function of 1 argument ("F1") if it satisfies:

	y = f(x), where x: sorted, real vector

Examples of "F1" datasets include **time domain** (`y(x=time)`) and **frequncy domain** (`X(w)`) data.

#### 2D Plot Support

InspectDR.jl also supports generic 2D plotting.  More specifically, the tool is capable of plotting arbitrary 2D datasets that satisfy:

	(x,y) = (u[i], v[i]), for i in [1...N]

Examples of of such plots (where x-values are not guaranteed to be sorted) include:

 - Nyquist plots
 - Lissajous plots
 - Smith/polar (S-Parameter) charts

#### Smith Charts

InpsectDR can generate Smith charts by specifying axes as `:smith`:

```
plot.axes = InspectDR.axes(:smith)
```

<a name="Bindings"></a>
#### Mouse/Keybindings

InspectDR.jl supports keybindings to improve/accelerate user control.  The following table lists supported bindings:

| Function | Key |
| -------: | :---: |
| Zoom out to full extents | `CTRL` + `f` |
| Zoom out horizontally to full extents | `CTRL` + `h` |
| Zoom out vertically to full extents | `CTRL` + `v` |
| Box zoom (in) | `right-click` + `mousemove`|
| Zoom in / zoom out | `+` / `-` |
| Zoom in / zoom out | `CTRL` + `mousewheel`|
| Pan up / pan down | &uArr; / &dArr; |
| Pan up / pan down | `mousewheel` |
| Pan left / pan right | &lArr; / &rArr; |
| Pan left / pan right | `SHIFT` + `mousewheel`|
| Pan anywhere | (`SHIFT` + `left-click`) + `mousemove` |

#### Mouse Pan/Zoom Locks
There are also keybindings to lock directionnality during mouse pan / zoom operations:

| Function | Key |
| -------: | :---: |
| Lock along horizontal | `h` |
| Lock along vertical | `v`|
| Allow both directions | `b` |

Note that many types & functions are not exported from InspectDR in order to avoid namespace pollution.  That being said, the module name will often be omitted below in an attempt to improve readability.

### Plot Objects

Principal objects:

 - **`InspectDR.Plot`**: An abstract plot object.
 - **`InspectDR.Plot2D <: Plot`**:  A 2D plot object.  Construct empty 2D plot using `InspectDR.Plot2D(title="Plot Title")`.
 - **`InspectDR.Multiplot`**:  A multi-plot object.  Construct empty multi-plot using: `InspectDR.Multiplot(title="Multiplot Title")`.

Subplots (`T<:Plot`) are added to a multi-plot object using the `add()` method:
```
mplot = InspectDR.Multiplot()
plot1 = InspectDR.Plot2D()
plot2 = InspectDR.Plot2D()

add(mplot, plot1)
add(mplot, plot2)
```

Similarly, the `add()` method adds waveforms to plots/subplots:
```
wfrm = add(plot1, x, y, id="Waveform label")
```

**WARNING:** Only `Vector` data can be added (`AbstractVector`/`Range` not currently supported).

#### Displaying plots

InspectDR provides the `GtkDisplay` object derived from `Base.Multimedia.Display`.  `GtkDisplay` is used in combination with `Base.display()`, to spawn a new instance of a GTK-based GUI.

To display a single `plot::Plot` object, one simply calls:
```
display(InspectDR.GtkDisplay(), plot)
```

Similarly, to display `mplot::Multiplot` object, one calls:
```
display(InspectDR.GtkDisplay(), mplot)
```

### Axis Scales

The X/Y scales of a `Plot2D` object can independently be selected to be one of the following:

 - `:lin`
 - `:log10`, `:log` (= `:log10`)
 - `:dB20`, `:dB10`

In order to display `plot::Plot2D` using semilog-x scales, one would set:
```
plot.axes = InspectDR.axes(:log10, :lin).
```

### Layout/Plot Style

Until a proper API is defined, one is encouraged to look at the `Layout` object to alter how plots are displayed:
```
?InspectDR.Layout
```

#### Legends

At this point in time, legends have limited configurability.  When displayed, legends will consume fixed horizontal real-estate.  The idea is to display a large number of labels without hiding the data area.

In order to display the legend of a `plot::Plot2D` object, one would set:
```
plot.layout.legend.enabled = true
```


Until a proper API is defined, one is encouraged to look at the `LegendLStyle` object to alter how legends are displayed:
```
?InspectDR.LegendLStyle
```

<a name="Config_Defaults"></a>
### Configuration/Defaults

Default InspectDR.jl settings can be overwritten once the module is loaded by editing the `InspectDR.defaults` structure:

```
#Dissalow SVG MIME output for performance reasons:
InspectDR.defaults.rendersvg = false

InspectDR.defaults.showtimestamp = true
InspectDR.defaults.fontname = "Sans"
InspectDR.defaults.fontscale = 1.2 #Bigger fonts

#Default values for data-area dimensions (saving single plot):
InspectDR.defaults.wdata = 500
InspectDR.defaults.hdata = 350

#Default values for plot dimensions (saving multi-plot):
InspectDR.defaults.wdata = 500
InspectDR.defaults.hdata = 350
```

Defaults can also be specified *before* importing InspectDR.jl with the help of `Main.DEFAULTS_INSPECTDR::Dict`.  Simply create the variable in your `~/.juliarc.jl` file, using the following pattern:
```
DEFAULTS_INSPECTDR = Dict(
	:fontname => "Sans",
	:showtimestamp => true,
)
```

<a name="KnownLimitations"></a>
## Known Limitations

 - Documentation is a bit limited at the moment.  See [Sample Usage](#SampleUsage) to learn from examples.
 - API is still a bit rough.  User often has to manipulate data structures directly.
 - Font control is not ideal.  The default font might not be available on all platforms - and the fallback font might not have Unicode characters to display exponent values (ex: `10⁻¹⁵`).  Some Greek characters might also be missing.
  - Workaround: Overwrite default font, as described in [Defaults](#Config_Defaults).
 - Legends not very configurable (currently optimized to display many labels @ cost of horizontal real-estate).
 - Does not yet render plot data in separate thread (will improve interactive experience with large datasets).
 - Mouse events currently function even outside data area (a bit odd).
 - Mouse cursor does not change as user switches mousemodes (ex: drag icon, cross-hairs, ...).
 - Significant slowdowns observed when zooming **deep** into non-F1 data... Can likely be solved by discarding data outside plot extents.
  - Workaround: make sure x-values are sorted (F1-acceleration discards data & is less prone to slowdowns).

### Compatibility

Extensive compatibility testing of InspectDR.jl has not been performed.  The module has been tested using the following environment(s):

 - Windows / Linux / Julia-0.5.0 / Gtk 0.10.4 (GTK+ 3) / Cairo 0.2.35

## Disclaimer

The InspectDR.jl module is not yet mature.  Expect significant changes.
